# Ethanol reforming over Pt/Mo<sub>2</sub>N(111)

This subdirectory contains the Jupyter notebook and Python code that 
was used for the construction of a Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) model 
for approximating the transition-state energy for reactions over 
Pt/Mo<sub>2</sub>N(111) [1].  The BEP model was fitted to data from 
references [1] and [2].
